The envisioned platform serves as a seamless connection between counselors and individuals seeking support. It incorporates a unique feature – a personality test – designed to assist counselors in understanding their clients better.
 This platform enhances the effectiveness of counseling sessions by providing insights into the individual's personality, aiding counselors in tailoring their approach for optimal support.
The pre-screening round utilizes a combination of emotional and tailored questions, leveraging the ChatGPT API for responsive and personalized interactions. This approach ensures that users receive meaningful and relevant responses based on their unique needs and emotional states.
The platform also streamlines the session booking process, offering a user-friendly interface for seamless scheduling. The integration of Razorpay for payment handling adds a secure and efficient financial transaction layer, ensuring a hassle-free experience for both counselors and users.
In essence, the platform optimizes the counseling process by combining advanced technologies, personality insights, and efficient session management, fostering a supportive environment for mental health and well-being.
